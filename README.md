My first calcaulator project done in Angular, currently following the Odin Project and even though I was instructed to do it in  js/html thought I would rather do it in Angular for practice sake. Was harder than expected but finally I got it all up and working! 

if you want to check it out for yourselves just clone the repo, npm install packages and ng serve in the CLI!

This project I learned a lot about using git branches for adding new features, some CSS flexbox tricks! Long live display:flex!
